Add 2 datasets to the data_set folder: train and test from the job
The code will refer to the data_set folder and look for data there. 

To load private dataset - load it into test. It should pick up.

There are two working notepads in the kod folder: 

am_formula1.ipynb - the first formula notepad is the first child's solution with low velocity (see presentation)
am_formula2.ipynb - notepad by the second formula - it is the main one

The trash_list folder is all the drafts as I struggled with the problem. don't know what for, but suddenly.

Not sure with the environment. I used to work in anaconda and I have a lot of stuff installed there and for the task I did not put anything new, but it seems wrong to dump here the environment from anaconda.
The code is based on YOLO 5, everything should work on the basis of its environment


Addition to the presentation and video. Already after they were made - the code was slightly refined. 
Changes in the code: After the sign is detected, it is cut, resized to 640x640 size and fed into another neuron. It looks for....holes to attach the number.  Between them is a fixed distance, they are clearly visible and do not need to make adjustments to the angle of inclination of the license plate.
Accordingly, the distance to the car is not found by the license plate width, but by the distance between the holes. Where holes are not found - will be the old way - the width.
