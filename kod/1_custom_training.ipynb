Thanks to that ClearML Tasks (which is what we call experiments) are also reproducible on different machines! With only 1 extra line, we can schedule a YOLOv5 training task on a queue to be executed by any number of ClearML Agents (workers).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use ClearML Data to version your dataset and then pass it to YOLOv5 simply using its unique ID. This will help you keep track of your data without adding extra hassle.
